hello let me introduce our startup idea that we have implemented during the hackathon so first

1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,399
let's introduce ourselves we are either graduates or students of worse of university of technology we

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,544
come from diverse backgrounds and data science machine learning web development and business and we are

3
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,431
all members of golem association

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,455
the problem we have noticed during our studying and doing a contact of academia and with

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,871
a research offense is that research is really really hard and writing in the tech is

6
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:32,576
also really hard so how about we make it a whole lot easier our solution is

7
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:37,504
to implement a get up copilot but for low-tech documents so what should this solution do

8
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:41,951
we discuss between ourselves and with our research or friends and we believe that we pinpointed

9
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:47,616
the three most important features that this solution should have the first one is real-time text

10
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:53,824
outer completion for both lotic and natural language the second feature is suggestions for citations and

11
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:58,944
assistance in creating bibliography and the third one is conducting a comprehensive review of the paper

12
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,312
to give constructive feedback to the user
